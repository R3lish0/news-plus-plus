# Welcome to News++

News++ is our platform for sharing tech-related thoughts, insights, and the occasional rant about the ever-evolving world of technology.

## Who We Are

We're two developers who decided that the tech world needed yet another blog (just kidding - we actually think we have something valuable to share).

**R3lish0** brings expertise in systems programming and has strong opinions about code quality that he's not afraid to share.

**stickyfingies** focuses on web technologies and user experiences, constantly exploring new frameworks and tools.

## What We Write About

Our articles cover a wide range of tech topics:

- **Development Tools & Workflows** - From editors to deployment pipelines
- **Programming Languages** - Deep dives into syntax, performance, and ecosystem
- **System Administration** - Linux, servers, and infrastructure management
- **Web Technologies** - Frontend frameworks, backend architectures, and everything in between
- **Industry Commentary** - Our takes on tech trends, decisions, and where things are heading

## Our Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Practical over theoretical** - Real-world examples and experiences
- **Honest opinions** - We'll tell you what works and what doesn't
- **Learning in public** - Sharing mistakes and lessons learned
- **Community engagement** - Technology is better when we build it together
